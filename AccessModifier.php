/*We need access modifiers in order to limit the modifications that code from outside the classes can do to the classes' methods and properties. Once we define a property or method as private, only methods that are within the class are allowed to approach it. So, in order to interact with private methods and properties, we need to provide public methods. Inside these methods, we can put logic that can validate and restrict data that comes from outside the class. */
